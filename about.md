Hi there, I'm TheGreatK0rnholio. I develop meme programs when I'm not at
my actual job, along with uploading on YouTube once every millenium. My hobbies include listening to Breaking Benjamin, posting cringe, and tormenting my computer (or virtual machines) with my own code when I have nothing better to do. 

A little bit about me:
I'm a 19 year old man, but turning 20 in a couple months as of when this was written in March 2022. Along with being a hobbyist programmer, I'm both studying and working full time and as for what I do in my spare time besides this, I'm a guitarist and learning to be a vocalist as well. 

Want to see my horrible YouTube channel that's full of nothing but memes and shitposts? I don't know why you would, but here you go anyway: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5x-R6o2fXfut7aAk6KEXDw

I also have an online radio station, KNLO-IP, being brought up soon which will also be sort of the demo for OpenENDEC to show what it can do for broadcasters. I'll add the link to it here when it's ready, but for now, enjoy our lovely text on this page.
