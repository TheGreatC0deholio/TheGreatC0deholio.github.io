##What is OpenENDEC?

Back around late 2019 I started to notice just how heavy the costs of proper Emergency Alert System (EAS) equipment could be at times, and noticed how it may have been related to the lack of required EAS broadcasts over multiple TV and radio stations I've tuned into while scanning the airwaves during weather events (among other things).

I then decided to look into developing a fully functional, free and open source software EAS encoder/decoder (abbreviated to ENDEC) solution that would make it very cost-effective and easy for broadcasters to keep up with the FCC's requirements. Using existing libraries and updating/enhancing them, as well as now beginning to add entire new utilities that work together with these libraries, that would become the OpenENDEC Project which would be made public in 2020.

### Development status and where to find OpenENDEC

OpenENDEC's modules besides the encoder are still in development, including a decoder, audio monitor, automation features and a graphical interface that allows the user to control all of these functions in one window. If you would like to check out OpenENDEC, you can find the repo at https://github.com/TheGreatC0deholio/OpenENDEC, or its GitHub Pages site at https://thegreatc0deholio.github.io/OpenENDEC where you can find more information on using the encoder via command line.
