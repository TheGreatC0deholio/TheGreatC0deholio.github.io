Here's yet another ShitDick post because AAAAAAAAAAA. 

So most of it was talked about in the previous post, but I'll go over some more wonderful things about my favorite abomination. Mostly, ***payloads. More fucking payloads.*** Let's get started on another post here on this obscure-ass website. 

## Name change, who cares

So with the implementation of the Omnivorous iNfection Engine, I've decided to change it from being "Trojan.Win32.ShitDick" to "Virus.Win32.ONE.ShitDick" to match one of its ancestors that it gets the infection engine from, Virus.Win32.ONE.ResonateII. 

## Payloads, payloads, and more payloads

So here are the next payloads being added:

First, I will be working on one that makes the cursor ***freak the fuck out*** because that sounds funny/annoying.

Second, I'm trying to make it change system sounds to various memes. Examples include making errors say "BRUH", re-enabling the startup sound and changing it to Yoda screaming or some shit, and making notifications on Windows 10 MUCH more annoying but also more funny.

Third, it'll start messing with window titles and moving your shit around the screen more.

There's more than that but a lot of it is meant to be a little more unexpected for the demo video when that finally happens.
