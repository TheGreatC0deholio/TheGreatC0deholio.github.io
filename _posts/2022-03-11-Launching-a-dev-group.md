Don't know where it'll go if anywhere, but here's the announcement of a possible dev/hacker (not the kind that steals shit or anything, mind you, more the kind that develops homebrew) group I'm starting for friends of mine that participate in some of my projects. Because I'm a fucking nerd, it's called Umbrella.

Well, it's stylized as "UᛖᛔᚱΣLLΛ" in typical text because, I don't fucking know, it just is. Anyway, this will be the group working on ShitDick and other projects. Currently OpenENDEC is still just going to be me, and currently I do most of the actual programming for projects like ShitDick, but a few friends do provide assistance with testing, designing things, and coming up with shit that could be funny to add; they're an integral part of it. 

Regardless of who else wants to be a part of it publicly, I'll be putting projects like ShitDick out as "TheGreatK0rnholio/UᛖᛔᚱΣLLΛ" and sort of representing anyone involved that prefers to stay behind the scenes, but I do hope it works out well because these weird projects are a lot of fun and collaborating on them with my friends has made it even more entertaining to me, and hopefully to everyone that sees the demo of it coming up as well.
